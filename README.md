# hello-world
I'm a UCL physics student and coding enthusiast. So far I only know Python but I'm hoping to expand into other languages soon. This is where I will upload all of my code.

Word_counter.py is just a simple definition I wrote to count the number of word recurrences in a text file. I used it for analysing song lyrics but it can be used for anything. Just note that it's case-sensitive, which is a bit annoying.

Molecular_mass_finder.py takes an input of a molecular formula and outputs a molecular mass. It was made to save the good people at UCL's Clean Materials Technology Group some time wasted on tedious calculations.

Any suggestions for improving or streamlining any of my code, feel free to get in touch.
